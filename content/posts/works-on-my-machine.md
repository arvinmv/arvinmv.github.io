I have a few days left before the Mrs and I fly out to Guam and once we get back, I start ramping up on my last 3 classes for my cloud computing BS degree. So I guess that leaves a little bit of time to play around and do some stuff without an assignment hanging over my head. 

I have a bunch of dependencies set up on my PC and it's probably going to be a PITA to get everything installed again on the lovely 2015 MBP sitting upstairs or any new laptop/desktop I get in the future. Right now, the plan is to create a repository that contains the code used to build the image that will serve as my development environment. It should have git, hugo, python3, terraform and a few other tools to get stood up across all of my devices. That will solve the whole 'Works on this machine' issue since I'll be able to pull the image down and work off of it. That's pretty much the point of Docker - to be able to run containers seamlessly regardless of the device. 

Some of these concepts were picked up at work, so if I'm able to replicate it in a frankenstein home lab manner, I think that means that things are actually sticking and connecting. Ok, enough talking.. time to work.
