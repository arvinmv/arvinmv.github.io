Welcome to the blog. I'm going to be using this blog to keep track of my progress and whatnot. Writing used to come a little more natural and now it feels so foreign, so hopefully using this as a platform for unloading the clip in my brain hopefully helps with that. Another benefit to constantly writing is to be able to look back on old posts as a means of keeping myself accountable.

A list of things of things that I'd like to get better at or learn in general are probably all of these technologies:

- Kubernetes
  - Hopefully earn my CKA certification this year.
- Terraform
  - I've been able to contribute to the modules we use at work, but I feel like I'm only scratching the surface
- Python
  - Probably just need to write more scripts for anything I can automate. I've made a script for moving repos over from github to codecommit. I think I'll write about that some other time.
- Go
  - The main motivator for wanting to learn go is to contribute to terraform modules that are open sourced or be able to write tests in terratest. Also, apparently everything these days in the DevOps landscape is written in go. Go figure. (da da tsss)
- Bash
  - This should probably be more important to me, but meh, I'll put it on the back burner and kind of learn it along the way.
