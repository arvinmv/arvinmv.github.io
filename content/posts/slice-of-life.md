Does anyone else think it's weird when bios or about me's are written in 3rd person? Well, I do, so we're not going to do that here.

My name is Arvin Vitug. Friends from the Navy call me 'V', everyone else typically uses 'Arv' if we'ere cool like that.
I spent my childhood and adolescence growing up in Guam from the village of Barrigada specifically, sometimes Barrigods (iykyk).
Just because I was born and raised on Guam doesn't mean I'm a native. Yep, Filipino blood in my veins.
I'm the product of a father who was always charasmatic and friendly and a mother who stands as the hardest working person I know.
My hobbies include walking our dog [Appa](https://www.instagram.com/appa.thegoldendoodle/), diving deep into reddit theories and discussions about films after watching them, traveling to parts unknown (RIP AB) and programming here and there.
I really enjoy music too! Check out my spotify [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/22lftefpchouqqdgnrzsqossi?si=4f914f0c66d744aa).

The last 10 years of my life have involved moving a lot. It feels weird hitting year 3 here in the DC area with no plans in sight for being a transplant in another city again. The itch is there though.
In time it will definitely happen. That's what it's about: the adventure of it all.

Thanks for reading. I'm interested in making this blog a little bit more about my little slice of life rather than just tech crap since that isn't entirely embededd in my soul.
So stay chooned for the next update!
