Long time no see pal

I haven’t blogged in a while and it feels like it’s been forever. I almost forgot I had this thing until I looked over what I used GitHub for (hint: barely anything lol)

To really catch up with most things though, here are some highlights:
- I got a new job as an SRE at VMware
- I graduated from online uni at WGU with a BS in Cloud Computing
- I’ve been making significant progress in the gym with bodybuilding

And the lowlights:
- I looked over the the things I said I would set out to do in my last few posts and honestly, I haven’t made much progress with them 

A metric that I’ve been really focusing on is happiness and it’s been showing for the past few months. I forgot how much being physically active plays a part in all that. Now that it has been incorporated back into my life, I need to strike a balance between work, relationships, fitness and learning. I’ve also felt less of a need to learn new things outside of work because there is so much learning baked into this new job that I feel mentally exhausted at the end of the day.

Oh, I also made an espn nba fantasy league discord cli personal project. Since I’m in an NBA fantasy league with friends, I thought it would be fun. This was mainly done to learn how to interact with APIs and to attempt to use some libraries that are used at work like click and unittest (I might try pytest instead since a lot of folks from the python community recommend it). I have some coworkers who rarely rely on the GUI so I wanted to try doing that to some extent to get more savvy with the terminal. 

Well that's it for now. Estaaa
