      <description>I have a few days left before the Mrs and I fly out to Guam and once we get back, I start ramping up on my last 3 classes for my cloud computing BS degree. So I guess that leaves a little bit of time to play around and do some stuff without an assignment hanging over my head.
I have a bunch of dependencies set up on my PC and it&amp;rsquo;s probably going to be a PITA to get everything installed again on the lovely 2015 MBP sitting upstairs or any new laptop/desktop I get in the future.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the blog. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using this blog to keep track of my progress and whatnot. Writing used to come a little more natural and now it feels so foreign, so hopefully using this as a platform for unloading the clip in my brain hopefully helps with that. Another benefit to constantly writing is to be able to look back on old posts as a means of keeping myself accountable.</description>
